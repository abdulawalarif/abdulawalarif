Ever since I was a little kid, I had quite a passion and fascination with Computers. With the growing interest,  
 I went through the tutorials to know more about what can be done on a computer, it was like magic, to be able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted. 

This passion led me to choose my bachelors major to be Computer Science and Engineering. I got my chance to pursue this at the International University of Business Agriculture and Technology. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, and higher mathematics- all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here where I learned truly how much there is yet to learn.

So, now in the industry, that passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful to be in this field.
